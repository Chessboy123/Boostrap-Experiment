One of the places that will benefit most from air conditioning is a school. During the summer, classrooms can overheat very quickly on hot days which results in reduced learning. When students are exposed to the hot weather it can reduce concentration, problem solving, social skills and more. A comfortable classroom environment is essential for learning.

Not only is a cool temperature important for learning but for health too. When anyone is exposed to hot temperatures for a long time it can lead to dehydration, heat stroke and more. Air conditioning is an essential for schools in hotter climates.</p>

     <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" >1. Larger Classroom Size Changes How A Teacher Teaches

The traditional classroom uses the smallest amount of space possible, with the maximum amount of desks or tables that will fit, often arranged in straight rows facing the front of the room. The teacher stands in the front, which creates an authoritarian transfer of information. Larger classrooms allow for a more creative arrangement with more flexible space, facilitating the subconscious transfer of information to take place differently. It allows the teacher to move more freely and become more Socratic in the pedagogy process.

2. Larger Classroom Size Changes How A Student Learns

Similarly to above, when students sit in rows squeezed into a hierarchical classroom, the psychological impact on learning is different than when the classroom is spacious and open. Instead of passively digesting the information from the front of the room, the mind can explore the information and learn it in an active way that aids retention.

3. Larger Classrooms Allow for Spatial Modalities

Research shows that the best type of learning occurs when children are placed in container systems where they can explore and interact with their environment, to learn in a dynamic way. With more room to operate, teachers can set up learning stations where students can learn with all five senses and, rather than digest and regurgitate information, they can process it, challenge their assumptions, and expand intellectual horizons.

4. Larger Classrooms Better Facilitate STEAM Learning

Larger, more modular/modal spaces in the classroom allow the convergence of science, technology, engineering, art, and math — combined with play and social engagement with classmates — to create an optimal learning atmosphere. This increases retention and comprehension, and does a better job of preparing students for future school and career success.

5. Larger Classrooms Promote Outside-the-box Thinking

As mentioned above, larger classrooms give teachers flexibility in lesson preparation and give students psychological and subconscious permission to think outside-the-box. When the social norms of the classroom are disrupted in the realm of the physical space, the constructed norms of learning are also displaced and options for alternative learning are opened.
